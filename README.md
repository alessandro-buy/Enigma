# Enigma

Here is my school enigma project.  The enigma was an encryption machine used by the Germans during World War II.  It was a complex machine involving several rotors and reflectors.  This program simulates the entire machine.  Given a configuration file, an input and an output file, you can run the simulated enigma machine.  

In order to run the code, simply clone the repo and run the following commands: 

To compile the code:
javac -g -Xlint:unchecked enigma/*.java


To run the code:
java -ea enigma.Main [configuration file] [input file] [output file]

The configuration file contains descriptions of the machine and the available rotors. The data are in free format.
